# Introduction

The project was developed during the course on Python Language Fundamentals for Data Analysis and Data Science, aiming at exploratory data analysis in Python language for the retail sector.

# Project

The libraries *numpy*, *pandas*, *matplotlib*, *seaborn* and *datetime* were imported and the data source used was a csv file.

For the exploratory analysis stage, the statistical summary of the 'Valor_Venda' variable and the occurrence of duplicate or null values ​​were verified.

During the execution of the project, 10 business questions were raised, namely:

1. Which City Has the Highest Sales Value of Products in the 'Office Supplies' Category?

2. What is the Total Sales by Order Date?

3. What is the Total Sales by State?

4. Which Are the 10 Cities with the Highest Total Sales?

5. Which Segment Had the Highest Total Sales?

6. What is the Total Sales by Segment and by Year?

7. How Many Sales Would Receive a 15% Discount?

8. Consider That the Company Decides to Grant a 15% Discount on the Previous Item. What Would Be the Average Sales Value Before and After the Discount?

9. What is the Average Sales by Segment, by Year and by Month?

10. What is the Total Sales by Category and Subcategory, Considering Only the Top 12 Subcategories?

Questions 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 were also answered graphically, using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to better represent the information.
